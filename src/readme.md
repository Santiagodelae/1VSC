Flight Opportunities is excited to support these efforts to solve some of the most important challenges facing space
exploration and Earth observation,” said Danielle McCulloch, acting program manager for Flight Opportunities at NASA’s
Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, California. “In working with the Small Spacecraft Technology program this 
year to offer opportunities for payloads hosted aboard commercial orbital platforms we can expand our reach to advance 
even more technologies from a variety of institutions and technical disciplines.”
The organizations developing the selected technologies will receive a grant or cooperative agreement allowing them to 
purchase flights from a U.S. commercial flight vendor that best meets their needs. As in previous years, the 2022 
solicitation included options for researchers to fly automated technology experiments unattended or to have one or more 
researchers fly alongside their technology payload on parabolic flights or suborbital rockets.
